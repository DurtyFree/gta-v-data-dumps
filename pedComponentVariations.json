This data dump is not available anymore for now. I deleted it as it wasn't 100% working anyway. 
It just caused a lot of headaches for me as people annoy me for something I released completely for free.

Meanwhile I have a 100% working dump with all SP & MP / DLC clothes + translated names, transparent images and 3d models for all existing clothes.
If you are interested to buying this data, feel free to message me at Discord: DurtyFree#3216 ( Or https://discordapp.com/users/153325414712999936 )

You can still browse the data on Pleb Masters: Forge, at https://forge.plebmasters.de/clothes/

Best regards
Durty
